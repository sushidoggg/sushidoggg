Hi there, Iâ€™m Joyce Qu (or sushidog), a fourth-year Computer Science undergraduate at the University of Toronto *seeking PhD opportunities for Fall 2026.*

My interests span security, theory, computer systems, and architecture. I enjoy being challenged with hard problems and developing creative solutions. 
Currently, I am working with Prof. Gururaj Saileshwar on attacks and defenses for Rowhammer, a DRAM read-disturbance vulnerability. 
Looking ahead, I hope to explore more security problems through a theoretical lens, such as developing secure data structures and applying formal methods on evaluating security mitigations.

Nice to meet you! ^^
